It has been one of the most engaging and practical experiences of my degree so far, offering a strong balance between theory and real-world application. From identifying a clear market opportunity to building investor-ready financials, the process challenged us to think creatively while remaining commercially focused. The Dragonsâ€™ Den pitch was a standout moment, helping us refine our communication and present with confidence to experienced professionals. I also gained a better appreciation for teamwork as we worked closely to develop our brand from the ground up. Overall, the module gave me a much deeper understanding of entrepreneurship and sustainability in business, and helped boost both my practical skills and personal confidence along the way."

It offered a valuable balance between theory and real-world application, allowing us to bring ideas to life through hands-on business planning, teamwork, and strategic thinking.

The Dragonsâ€™ Den experience was a standout highlight, pushing us to refine our communication, pitch with confidence, and receive constructive feedback from real industry professionals. It was also great to work in a collaborative environment that mirrored real startup dynamics, where adaptability and shared leadership were key. Iâ€™ve come away from this module with a stronger understanding of entrepreneurship, branding, and what it takes to bring a sustainable product to market. Overall, itâ€™s boosted both my business knowledge and personal confidence."
