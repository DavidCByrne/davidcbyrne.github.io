# SQL

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
We started the semester out by learning about SQL. Throughout this learning I deepened my understanding of relational databases and SQL syntax, constructing ERDs, defining tables with proper primary and foreign keys, and mastering CRUD operations. Writing queries to join tables, calculate aggregates, and apply normalisation principles helped to sharpen my ability to think logically about data relationships and efficiencies. We had an exam on this where I achieved 89%, which not only validated my proficiency with the core SQL concepts but also boosted my confidence to tackle complex data challenges in the future.

# Power BI
Building on from our work on SQL, I then delved into learning Power BI. For this, we had a group presentation of dashboards we created. We picked a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data) on USA car sales from 2014/15 covering vehicles registered between 1982 and 2015. We leveraged our skills learnt from SQL to drop unnecessary columns, standardise the text, and remove any rows with >2 null values and unrealistic values. We also added in a new column so we could create more meaningful visualisations. We then created Power BI dashboards comrprising key information that the companies can use, which we presented and provided recommendations based on the data.

Finally, for the last 5 weeks of the semester, we explored the basics of Python.
