# Kerrygold Strategic Evaluation
For this year long module, we partook in a group project which accounted for 50% of our final grade. We had to pick a client company in which we would do a strategic evaluation of and propose 3 recommendations. Ornua, with a focus on their consumer brand Kerrygold is who we selected. As we dove into the strategic analyses, from PESTLE and Porter's Five Forces to VRIO and value-chain mapping, I saw firsthand how each of our team member's expertise added depth to the report, which ultimately earned us a grade of 80%. The report can be seen below. Additionally, we had to pitch our analysis, where myself and two others presented, acting as management consultants and we managed to score 78%! These great results set us up really nicely for the individual case analysis which accounted for the other 50% of our final grade.
