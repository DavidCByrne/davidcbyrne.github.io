My time at DCU has been defined by growth, both intellectually and personally. From the moment I arrived as a first-year Business Studies student, I immersed myself in the coursework, celebrating each high-scoring exam, and learning how to approach problems with curiosity and precision. While moving away from home to live up in college was difficult, it has really defined who I am as a person. It taught me adaptability, resilience, and gave me confidence to embrace new challenges. I picked this course as I wasn't sure what I wanted to do in life, hence, I left my options open by picking a broad course. I learnt a wide skillset across analytics, finance, marketing, and management, where I then realised that my true interest lies in data analytics and finance. Throughout my degree, I have consistently achieved first class honours results in each year of my studies, ranking 2nd in a course of over 200 students in the process!
