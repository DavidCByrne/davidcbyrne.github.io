My time at DCU has been defined by growth, both intellectually and personally. From the moment I arrived as a first-year Business Studies student, I immersed myself in the coursework, celebrating each high-scoring exam, and learning how to approach problems with curiosity and precision. While moving away from home to live up in college was difficult, it has really defined who I am as a person. It taught me adaptability, resilience, and gave me confidence to embrace new challenges.
