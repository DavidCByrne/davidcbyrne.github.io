# Projects

Check out some of the projects I have worked on throughout my academic journey!

## Reflection on the ePortfolio

Reflecting on the ePortfolio process as a whole, it’s been a genuinely valuable and rewarding experience. Damien’s guidance throughout the module made a huge difference. His interactive slides, step-by-step walkthroughs, and clear breakdown of each section made what initially seemed like a daunting task feel manageable. The way he paced the content and encouraged us to engage with it actively helped me stay on track and build confidence as I went.

Using Quarto and all the associated tools was completely new to me, and I’ll admit there was a learning curve at the start. Figuring out how to format everything, organise the layout, and troubleshoot little issues took some time, but once I got into the flow, it became a lot more intuitive. By the end, I felt proud of how much I’d learned, from Markdown and HTML basics to how to present my academic and professional journey in a clear, structured way.

Looking ahead, I fully intend to continue updating my ePortfolio throughout my career. It’s a powerful tool, not only for reflecting on how far I’ve come, but also for showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences to future employers. In such a competitive job market, I know having a well-crafted, living portfolio will really help me stand out.
